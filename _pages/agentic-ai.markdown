<span class="important">Developing agentic software?</span>

I am posting content here that will help you get idea on building agentic software systems.
Before you proceed, you need to remember...
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Machines don't learn or think like humans do! It's all math.</span><br />
<a href="/2025/04/02/is-ml-really-making-machines-intelligent/">Know more...</a>
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, crafting agentic software depends mainly on five maturity areas...
<br />
<br />
1️⃣ Complexity of the problem and how agents can help (will it really benefit with such a solution?)<br />
2️⃣ The level of accuracy and human intervention required (beware, LLMs are probabilistic software!)<br />
3️⃣ Agent personas with clear objectives: <a href="/2025/04/26/llms-and-bayes-theorem/">Write clever prompts</a> using <a href="/2025/06/22/prompt-engineering/">prompt engineering techniques</a><br />
4️⃣ Thinking simple workflows: Restrospecting the output at every step, understand what can improve accuracy<br />
5️⃣ Implications on security, privacy and compliance
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">To build capabilities in agentic AI, you could use this three step process.</span>
<br />
<br />
I followed this three step process myself.
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Step 1: Be an efficient software craftsman</span>
<br />
<br />
✅ <a href="/2025/08/19/what-will-benefit-from-genai-and-takeoff/">Stop thinking that AI is the answer to all your problems</a>!<br />
✅ Be part of, or develop an excellent engineering culture<br />
✅ Collaborate, experiment and learn; understand what others are doing<br />
✅ Learn Python, async programming, API development and one database<br/>
<a href="#">Why Python?</a><br />
✅ Read why LLMs are called probabilistic systems, use ChatGPT or Gemini and experiment with prompts
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Step 2: Understand the building blocks</span>
<br />
<br />
✅ Start small; build a simple chatbot and experiment with different prompt techniques<br />
✅ Learn vector databases, tokens, text embedding, chunks, etc<br />
✅ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN_2fnOPY-M">Build a RAG workflow</a>, connect it with the chatbot, add memory - Try <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-rag">Agentic RAG</a>!<br />
✅ Learn different RAG techniques and simple tool usage with LLMs<br />
✅ Understand the economics of cloud computing
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Step 3: Develop agents</span>
<br />
<br />
✅ Build a system with two agents that interact with each other, define agent goals<br />\
✅ Optimize tokens by engineering agent context!<br />
✅ Learn structured inputs, structured outputs and guardrails<br />
✅ Learn agentic workflow patterns and orchestration, add multiple agents<br />
✅ Provide tools to the agents, learn <a href="/2025/07/04/simple-mcp-server-configured-with-claude-desktop/">Model Context Protocol</a><br />
✅ Logging, monitoring, LLMOps and deployment<br />
✅ Dive deep into evals.
<br />
<br />
<span class="important">Btw, did you look at your data?</span> 
<br />
<br />
Your AI superpowers are only as good as your data is. Most enterprises have data that is highly unorganized and a mess.
